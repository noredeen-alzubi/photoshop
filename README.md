# photoshop
Image editing application that explores algorithms that apply popular edits like blurring and sharpening images

IMP: the application only uses an interface to blur images. To try the rest of the edits, set event boolean to true and then uncomment
the function you would like to run in the run method. Comments will guide you.

Note: The new edited images appear in the images folder, and they are also displayed in the UI. Blur can be applied to already edited 
images

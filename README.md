Image editing application that explores algorithms that apply popular edits like blurring and sharpening images

IMP: the application only uses an interface to blur images. To try the rest of the edits, follow the comments which will guide you to get that functionality.

Note: The new edited images appear in the images folder, and they are also displayed in the UI. Blur can be applied to already edited 
images
